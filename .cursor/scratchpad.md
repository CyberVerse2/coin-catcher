# Coin Catcher - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Coin Catcher is a fast-paced browser game designed to be a secure, budget-controlled family gaming experience. Players catch falling silver and gold coins to earn points and climb leaderboards. A key feature is the currency model where 1 in-game coin equals 0.1 USDC. Each player starts with 100 coins. The game will leverage Coinbase Smart Wallet for users to create subaccounts for children, tied to their USDC balance, allowing for seamless on-chain allowances and power-up purchases without disruptive pop-ups. The tech stack includes Next.js for the frontend and backend API, Prisma as the ORM, and MongoDB as the database. The project aims to implement the features outlined in the provided Game Design Document (GDD).

## Key Challenges and Analysis

*   **Coinbase Smart Wallet Integration:** Implementing subaccounts (EIP-7895), managing USDC-backed coin balances, on-chain allowances, and ensuring gasless/seamless power-up purchases will be complex. Requires careful study of Coinbase SDK and smart contract interactions (even if simulated).
*   **Real-time Gameplay Performance:** Ensuring smooth animations, responsive controls, and accurate physics for coin falling and catching within a Next.js browser environment.
*   **Database Design & ORM Strategy:** Creating an efficient and scalable MongoDB schema using Prisma for users, subaccounts, game sessions, high scores, and financial transactions. Queries must be optimized for performance, especially for the leaderboard.
*   **Security:** Protecting user wallet connections, ensuring secure management of subaccount permissions and spending limits, and safeguarding API endpoints against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Instant Power-Up Mechanism:** Designing and implementing the UI and backend logic for power-ups that are activated and paid for instantly from subaccounts without a traditional shop interface.
*   **High Score System Scalability:** Building a persistent leaderboard that can handle a large number of entries and updates efficiently.
*   **Adherence to GDD:** Consistently implementing features as described in the GDD, including UI/UX, game mechanics, and technical architecture.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handling blockchain interactions and API calls without blocking the user interface or gameplay.

## High-level Task Breakdown

The following tasks will guide the development process. Each task includes success criteria to verify completion.
2.  **Task 2: Prisma & MongoDB Setup in existing codebase**
    *   Description: Install Prisma and the Prisma client. Configure Prisma to connect to a local or cloud MongoDB instance. Define initial Prisma schema for `User` (id, email/walletAddress, createdAt) and `HighScore` (id, score, userId, createdAt, userName).
    *   Success Criteria: Prisma successfully connects to MongoDB. `User` and `HighScore` models are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. `npx prisma db push` (or equivalent for schema application) runs without errors. Basic programmatic tests to create/read a User and HighScore entry via Prisma Client are successful.

3.  **Task 3: Basic Game Canvas & Coin Spawning (Frontend)**
    *   Description: Create a new Next.js page for the game (e.g., `/game`). Implement a 2D canvas (using HTML5 Canvas API or a simple library like p5.js if preferred). Implement logic for silver and gold coins to fall from the top of the canvas at random horizontal positions. Implement the 10:1 silver to gold spawn ratio and different point values (Silver: +1, Gold: +5).
    *   Success Criteria: Game page renders a canvas. Silver and gold coins fall continuously from the top. The spawn ratio and point values are verifiable (e.g., via console logs or on-screen debug info).

4.  **Task 4: Player Control & Coin Catching Logic (Frontend)**
    *   Description: Implement a "basket" controllable by the player (e.g., using mouse movement or arrow keys). Implement collision detection between the basket and falling coins. When a coin is caught, it should disappear, and the player's score should update.
    *   Success Criteria: Player can move the basket horizontally. Caught coins are removed from the canvas. An on-screen score updates correctly based on the type of coin caught.

5.  **Task 5: Game Session Management (Frontend + Backend Logic)**
    *   Description: Implement game start functionality. Implement a 60-second timer for each game session. Implement game over conditions: either the timer reaches zero, or the player misses three coins (coins that reach the bottom of the canvas without being caught).
    *   Success Criteria: Game starts upon a user action. A visible timer counts down from 60 seconds. Game ends when the timer expires or after three coins are missed. A "Game Over" state is triggered.

6.  **Task 6: High Score Submission & Display**
    *   Description:
        *   Backend: Create a Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/highscore`) that accepts a score and a playerName/userId. This route will use Prisma to save the score to the `HighScore` collection in MongoDB.
        *   Frontend: On game over, allow the player to enter a name (or use a logged-in user's identifier). Submit the score and name to the backend API. Create a separate page or a section on the game page to display a global leaderboard fetched from another API endpoint (e.g., GET `/api/highscore`).
    *   Success Criteria: Player scores and names are successfully saved to MongoDB via the API. The leaderboard page/section correctly displays the top scores, ordered appropriately.

7.  **Task 7: User Authentication & Coinbase Smart Wallet Integration**
    *   Description:
        *   Frontend: Integrate and verify the existing "Connect Wallet" button functionality with Coinbase Smart Wallet.
        *   Backend: Implement logic to fetch the user's USDC balance from their connected wallet upon authentication. Calculate and assign the corresponding in-game coin balance (1 coin = 0.1 USDC; initial balance is 0 if no USDC). Ensure the `User` model and API correctly handle user creation/lookup based on wallet address and manage their dynamic coin balance.
        *   Integration: Build upon the existing implementation of subaccounts and transaction signing for features like parent-controlled child subaccounts and instant power-up purchases.
        *   Research: If the current subaccount implementation is basic, continue research and planning for the full EIP-7895 capabilities, especially around detailed spend permissions.
    *   Success Criteria: "Connect Wallet" button successfully connects to Coinbase Smart Wallet. User's in-game coin balance is correctly determined and displayed based on their USDC wallet balance. User model handles wallet addresses and dynamic coin balances derived from USDC. Existing subaccount/transaction signing features are confirmed as a suitable base. Research on advanced EIP-7895 features is documented if necessary.

8.  **Task 8: Dynamic In-Game Currency Management**
    *   Description:
        *   Frontend: Display the player's dynamic "in-game coin" balance, derived from their USDC wallet balance (as established in Task 7; 0.1 USDC = 1 coin).
        *   Backend: The `User` model's `coinBalance` field (Prisma) must be updated dynamically based on the fetched USDC wallet balance. This might involve fetching on demand or setting up listeners if feasible.
    *   Success Criteria: User's in-game coin balance accurately reflects their USDC wallet holdings and is displayed correctly. The `coinBalance` in the database is managed/updated based on their wallet's USDC amount.

9.  **Task 9: Power-Up System - Basic Implementation (Frontend Focus)**
    *   Description:
        *   Frontend: Display placeholder icons for power-ups as described in the GDD (e.g., basket expansion, time slowdown, score multiplier). On click, simulate a purchase by deducting a predefined cost (e.g., 0.2-0.6 coins) from the player's displayed coin balance. Implement one basic power-up effect (e.g., basket temporarily becomes wider).
        *   Backend (Conceptual): Plan API endpoints for handling power-up activations and linking them to subaccount transactions (for future integration).
    *   Success Criteria: Clicking a power-up icon deducts the cost from the displayed coin balance. At least one power-up (e.g., wider basket) has a visible effect in the game.

10. **Task 10: UI/UX Polish based on GDD (Initial Pass)**
    *   Description: Implement the HUD layout (score, timer, remaining coins/misses). Create simple modals for "Game Over" and "Settings" (if any basic settings are planned). Apply a clean, flat 2D vector art style using basic shapes and colors if actual assets are unavailable.
    *   Success Criteria: Game interface includes the described HUD elements. Game Over modal is functional. Visual style is clean and functional, approximating the GDD's intent.

11. **Task 11: Basic Testing Strategy & Implementation**
    *   Description: Write basic unit tests for critical functions (e.g., scoring logic, timer logic, coin spawning probability). Plan integration tests for API endpoints (e.g., high score submission).
    *   Success Criteria: Key utility functions have unit tests. API endpoints for high scores are tested (e.g., using Postman or a testing library).

12. **Task 12: Documentation - User Flows & API (Initial Draft)**
    *   Description: Based on GDD Section 5, create initial textual or simple diagrammatic user flows for: Landing -> Connect Wallet -> Role Detection (mock), Parent (mock setup), Child -> Game Home -> Gameplay -> Game Over -> Leaderboard. Draft basic API documentation for the implemented endpoints (high score).
    *   Success Criteria: Initial user flow documentation exists. API endpoints (submit score, get leaderboard) are documented with request/response formats.
